# Canny.C is an edge detection program that employs the canny algorithm.
# This particular program is hard coded to run on PGM files that are 255 x 255 pixels.
# I have included a test image in this edge detection folder.

# The program can be compiled with gcc and takes in a number of arguments on the command
# line to run. It will produce 3 output images as pgm files. The first represents a magnitude image of
# the edges, the second represents all of the potential pixel peaks, and the third image
# are the clean edges produced after organizing the peaks into a histogram and only
# selecting those of a certain threshold.

# The command line arguments are in order: input image, magnitude image destination, sigma variable, peaks image destination,
# final histogram image destination, histogram threshold value
# for example: ./canny garb34.pgm image.pgm 1 image2.pgm image3.pgm .05
