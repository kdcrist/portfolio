This is where you can find the source code for my projects.

These are just a few projects I have been developing. Most of them are ongoing projects.

The simon game is functional and can be ran in the Eclipse IDE. As of now the simon game progresses at
the same speed no matter how high the score has grown. I plan on adding sound and decreasing the time
interval between flashes.

The Kay's Kakes files are an inprogress project that will eventually go live for a custom cake maker.
